# Project: Online Piggy Bank

## Overview

This project involves the development of an online piggy bank system. The system consists of a frontend web app built with a modern web framework (React/Vue/Angular or plain JavaScript), and backend APIs implemented in any language/framework of your choice. The data is expected to persist in a database.

## Features

1. **Add Money:**
   - Users can add money to the piggy bank.

2. **Transaction History:**
   - Users can view all transactions in the piggy bank.

3. **Withdrawal:**
   - To withdraw money from the piggy bank, users have to break the piggy bank.
   - Breaking the piggy bank results in the user receiving all the money from it.

4. **Piggy Bank Lifecycle:**
   - Once the piggy bank is broken, users can start a new piggy bank.
   - At any given time, there can be only one piggy bank in the system.
   - Users can create a new piggy bank only when the previous one is destroyed.

## Notes

- The assignment will be evaluated based on code quality, API design, and software practices.
- Authentication and authorization can be omitted for simplicity.
- The UI design can be kept simple, with an emphasis on component design.
- The web app can be either multi-page or a single-page application.

## Design Considerations

Feel free to make your design decisions and assumptions regarding styling, UI, and UX. The wireframe provided is intentionally kept simple, and you are encouraged to showcase your creativity and design thinking.
